The netCDF-4 C++ API was developed for use in\r\nmanaging fusion research data from CCFE's innovative MAST (Mega Amp\r\nSpherical Tokamak) experiment.\r\n\r\n  [netcdf-cxx4]: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-cxx/\r\n\r\nAppel's C++ implementation is a complete read/write interface for\r\nnetCDF-4, but can also be used as an alternative to the older netCDF-3\r\nC++ interface, to write classic-format netCDF-3 files as well as\r\nnetCDF-4 classic model files. The new API is implemented as a layer\r\nover the netCDF-4 C interface, which means bug fixes and performance\r\nenhancements in the C interface will be immediately available to C++\r\ndevelopers as well. It replaces a previous partial netCDF-4 C++\r\ninterface developed by Shanna Forbes.\r\n\r\nThe new API makes use of standard C++ features such as namespaces,\r\nexceptions, and templates, none of which were included in the first\r\nnetCDF-3 C++ API developed in the mid-90's. The earlier netCDF-3 C++\r\nAPI is still supported and available in the source distribution, but\r\ndevelopers who are thinking of eventually upgrading to use of the\r\nenhanced data model should consider using Lynton's new API.\r\n\r\nWe're grateful for Appel's development and CCFE's contribution of the\r\nnew open-source code for the netCDF-4 C++ API, and hope C++ developers\r\nin the netCDF community will find it useful! Feedback is appreciated,\r\nand should be directed to [Lynton Appel][la_email].\r\n\r\n  [la_email]: mailto:Lynton.Appel@ccfe.ac.uk\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nInstalling the C++ interface requires the additional flag\r\n--enable-netcdf-4 to be used during the configure stage of the\r\ninstallation, for example enter\r\n\r\n      ./configure --enable-cxx-4 [plus other options]\r\n\r\nNote that the \"configure\" script must be generated using\r\n\r\n      autoreconf -if\r\n\r\nTo build the C++ interface guide, change to the cxx4 directory of the\r\ndistribution and enter\r\n\r\n      doxygen\r\n\r\nBy default, HTML documentation will be installed in cxx4/doc/html;\r\nother options may be specified according to the settings contained in\r\nthe file \"Doxyfile\" (details of alternative settings are documented at\r\n[doxygen][dox_l]). Note that as a prerequisite for generating the\r\ndocumentation, the system will need to have doxygen and\r\n[Graphviz][g_l] installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [dox_l]: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen\r\n  [g_l]: http://www.graphviz.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n### Examples of usage\r\n\r\nExamples codes can be found by selecting the \"Examples\" tab.\r\n",
